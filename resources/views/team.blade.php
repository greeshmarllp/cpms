                    <p class="top15">John was a former full-time Caboolture Shire Councillor with over 10 years experience in local government and is also a retired professional infantry soldier. John has embellished the local real estate industry with his wealth of experience and knowledge in property matters in the Caboolture and Morayfield region. In fact it was the ability to put to use his "encyclopaedia-like" knowledge of Caboolture Real Estate, Development and Urban Planning garnered from working across all levels of government, that sparked John's interest in becoming a real estate </p>
                    <p class="top30">principal at Caboolture Property Management and Sales. "Within this region I'm aware of what can be achieved in relation to property and the land zoning in the current council regional plan. This is a great help to investors who want to buy and sell because I'm in a position to be able to provide advice for either commercial or residential development", John says. This is a testament to the growth of the region and John's commitment to providing a skilled and professional service.</p>
